# Hands-On Design Patterns with C++



## 1. Introduction to Inheritance and Polymorphism

继承和多态

Combining algorithms and data to be operated into single objects

An object is a concrete instantiation of a class

It is one of the signs of good design when the data is well encapsulated in the classes, and the methods have limited interaction with external data. A well-designed class hast mostly, or only, private data members, and the only public methods are those needed to express the public interface of the class

好的设计是，数据被封装在类内，而方法与外界的数据只有有限的交互。一个好的类设计基本上只有私有数据乘员，并且，仅有的那些公共方法，也是该类需要有的公共接口。
